# cplan
An open source planning software (in C). Meant for tracking progress on whatever high school and university assignments you have outgoing.

## Currently Implemented Features:


## In Progress Features
- Add course codes (6 charcters), Tasks, and Individual Goals

## Planned Additions
- Auto deletion of tasks after due date passes


I also have a discord for development of this software.
